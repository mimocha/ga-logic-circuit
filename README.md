# Generation of Logic Circuits with Genetics Algorithm
## An Examination in Physical Implementation

-----

#### Background:

This repository is for programming files for my bachelor degree's dissertation project.

The main objective for this dissertation is to research the application of evolutionary hardware, and implementing genetics algorithm and cellular automaton to generate logical circuits.

The research is done on the Terasic DE0-Nano-SoC development board. The board is equipped with Intel Cyclone V FPGA chip, and ARM Cortex A9 microprocessor.

Thus the programming language used is Verilog HDL for the FPGA, and C++ for Genetics Algorithm program.
